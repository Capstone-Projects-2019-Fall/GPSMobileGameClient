/* CardInventoryZone Description:
 * A CardInventoryZone is a flexible UI element used for displaying a graphical list of Cards. Similar to the CardScrollList, the main use cases
 * for a CardInventoryZone are the crafting and deckbuilding/homebase scenes, although theoretically the prefab should be encapsulated properly and
 * flexible enough to add to other scenes in the future. */
